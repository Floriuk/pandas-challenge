Module Challenge 4 
First, I started by merging the two data files requested. 
Then I took a look of the information and started calculating the data specified, such as: 
The number of unique schools, total students, budget, etc. 
These information was converted to a data frame. To show the total values.
After that, the information was processed to represent the information per school in a data frame.
Then, the schools were examined in the areas of math and reading, creating data frames that showed how this schools performed. 
Next, the information was used to analyze the schools by their spending rate and the size of the school.
To sum up, the info was processed to analyze the schools by their type, charter and district.
